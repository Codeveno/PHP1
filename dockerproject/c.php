//MVC is model view controller.
//MVC is a software design pattern that separates an application into three main components: Model, View, and Controller.   
// it separate business logic from presentation logic.
//Model: The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, including retrieving, storing, and processing it. The Model does not depend on the View or Controller.
//View: The View is responsible for displaying the data to the user. It presents the data in a format that is easy to understand and interact with. The View does not contain any business logic; it simply displays the data provided by the Model.
//Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input, processes it (often by calling methods on the Model), and then updates the View accordingly. The Controller contains the application logic and coordinates the flow of data between the Model and View.
//MVC is used in web applications to separate concerns, making the codebase more organized and maintainable. It allows developers to work on different components independently, which can lead to better collaboration and easier debugging. Additionally, it promotes reusability of components, as the same Model can be used with different Views or Controllers.
