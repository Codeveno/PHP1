//mvc is a design pattern

//a class is a blueprint for an object
//an object is an instance of a class
//a class is a llection of properties and methods
//a property is a variable that belongs to a class

//example if we have a house as a class
////the house has a color, size, and number of rooms
//the house has a method to open the door
//the house has a method to close the door

//if we take house's blueprint as a class
//and we build a house from that blueprint
//the house is an object
//the house is an instance of the class

//we can create multiple houses from the same blueprint
//The house in this case is a class
//The blueprint is an object
